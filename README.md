# SythesisOfGatesDynamicProgramming
This is a implementation of an IEEE "Synthesis Of gates" which involves finding a right set of gates to the appropriate input pins such that the end delay of the output is minimized. This project involves concept of dynamic programming which is used to resolve the complex np-hard problem
